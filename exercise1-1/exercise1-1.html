    <h1>Exercise 1.1</h1>
    <p>Your sketch:</p>
    <div class="guidance">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Create a sketch with a 600px by 600px canvas.</p>
            <p>Give the sketch a background colour of your choosing (other than black or white). The example output in the 
                video uses a random background colour but that's not a requirement.
            </p>
            <p>Generate 100 random rectangles (random coordinates and random dimensions) and store the generated data in an array 
                of object literals. Each object should contain all the information needed to make one rectangle (coordinates and dimensions). 
                It is recommended that you keep the rectangles small, ideally between 5 and 10 pixels in width and height.
            </p>
            <p>Draw the rectangles on the canvas. Rectangles that are stored at <em>even</em> indicies should be filled in black and rectangles 
            stored at <em>odd</em> indicies should be filled in white.</p>
            <p>When the user presses the space bar, generate 100 new random rectangles and store them appropriately. In the video, a new random background 
                colour is also chosen when the user presses space. You don't need to do this unless you feel like it! 
            </p>
            <p>When you're finished, check your work using <a href="check-exercise1-1.html">check-exercise1-1.html</a>.</p>
            <p>Expected output:</p>

                    <p>You will need a global array to store the rectangle information. Because you will need to call the p5.js <code>random()</code> function, 
                    you can't populate the array until after <code>createCanvas()</code> has been called (this is a quirk of p5.js). It is recommended that you put 
                    the code to populate the array in its own function, which you then call imediately after calling <code>createCanvas()</code>.</p>
                    <p>To populate the array, you will need a for loop. Inside the for loop, create an object literal that has a key for each property you would need to 
                        draw a rectangle. The value of each key should be randomly generated. Add the new object literal to your global array.
                    </p>
                    <p>To set the fill colour of a shape based on its index in the array, you can use a simple conditional. To check if a number is even or odd, you can 
                        use the % (remainder / modulo) operator. Remember that an even number is divisible by 2...
