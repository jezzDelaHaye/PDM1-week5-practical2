    <h1>Exercise 1.3</h1>
    <p>Your sketch:</p>
    <div class="guidance">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Create a sketch with a 400px by 400px canvas.</p>
            <p>Virtual environments often contain obstacles that the player cannot move through. Your task 
                is to create a simple environment with a moveable player object and an obstacle. The player 
                object can be moved with the arrow keys but it can't pass through the obstacle. See the video 
                below. The green square is the player and the black rectangle is the obstacle.
            </p>
            <p>Create two global objects, one called <code>player</code> and one called <code>obstacle</code>.</p>
            <p>Set the <code>player</code> properties as shown in the table below:</p>
            <table class="table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Key</th>
                        <td>Value</td>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <th><code>x</code></th>
                        <td>50</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th><code>y</code></th>
                        <td>50</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th><code>size</code></th>
                        <td>50</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>Set the <code>obstacle</code> properties as shown in the table below:</p>
            <table class="table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Key</th>
                        <td>Value</td>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <th><code>x</code></th>
                        <td>150</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th><code>y</code></th>
                        <td>100</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th><code>width</code></th>
                        <td>100</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th><code>height</code></th>
                        <td>200</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>Draw a square to represent the <code>player</code> object and a rectangle to represent 
            the <code>obstacle</code>. Use the default drawing mode for rectangles.</p>
            <p>Make it possible to move the player using the usual w-a-s-d keys. The player 
                should move smoothly and continuously if a w-a-s-d key is held down and stop 
                moving if the key is released. It should not be possible for the player to 
                overlap or pass through the obstacle.
            </p>

                    <p>To make the player move smoothly and continuously, use the <code>keyIsPressed</code> system 
                        variable rather than an event function.
                    </p>
                    <p>To prevent the player from moving over the obstacle, you will need to add logic that checks if 
                        moving in the selected direction would make the player square overlap with the obstacle on any 
                        side. You have seen many similar examples of this type of logic--look at examples that check if 
                        a shape has collided with an edge of the canvas or if a point (such as the mouse) is in or out of 
                        bounds of some shape. 
                    </p>
                    <p>The logic is much easier if you write logic to work out if the player <em>can</em> move in the 
                    intended direction than if you write logic to work out if the player <em>can't</em> move. For example, on the y axis:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If the new position of the player is completely above the obstacle, it can move</li>
                        <li>If the new position of the player is completely below the obstacle, it can move</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
